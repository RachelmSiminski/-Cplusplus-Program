**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room is a company which creates games. They requested help in expanding an existing game, Draw it Or Lose it, to include a web-based version in addition to the current version which is an Android app. The web-based version needed to allow for multiple players within more than one team, each with unique usernames. Along with this only one version of the game would be allowed to exist in the memory at any given time.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I did quite a bit of research in an effort to make sure I had addressed each section of the characteristics table appropriately. This extensive research I did helped me to make strong recommendations with supporting evidence.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

I did not like the design document at first, because it felt like it was confusing me more than helping, but once I hit my stride in it I realized it was helping make things more clear for me in the code. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I misread the prompt in the first submission and was under the impression that I was supposed to complete the entire document. I did as much as I could at the time and submitted it not fully complete but complete enough to get an okay grade, but the sections I missed ended up being the specific ones needed for that submission. If I could go back I would make sure to read the prompt more thoroughly and maybe this wouldn’t have been so difficult initially.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

It’s important to consider the user’s needs because they will ultimately be the one interacting with the program the most. In this case the user’s needs for high performance, optimization and efficiency were addressed through the strategic use of memory. For one example, the game will pre-cache images prior to use so that they can be accessed quickly and efficiently, allowing the user to engage in a buffer free game!

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I approached this as a chance to learn. I did my research when I was answering each section to make sure that I fully understood what I was talking about. I will continue to treat this as a research task to make sure that I am always finding up-to-date information and not just assuming I know the best choice.
